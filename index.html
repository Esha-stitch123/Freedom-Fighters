            My family is truly one of life’s greatest treasures. It provides me with a sense of belonging and support that is hard to find elsewhere. The bonds I form with my family members are often the strongest and most enduring, offering a foundation of love, trust, and understanding. Whether it’s sharing laughter during joyful moments or offering comfort during difficult times, my family is always there to provide a sense of stability and warmth. The memories I create with my family are often the most cherished, and the lessons I learn from them shape me into the person I become. Overall, my family is a source of strength, inspiration, and happiness that enriches my life in countless ways.

            Gandhi's vision and philosophy are pillars of the work of the United Nations. Part of his genius lay in his ability to see the inter-connectedness and the unity between all things. His political achievements included leading the movement that ended colonial rule in India, using peace, love and integrity to prevail.
